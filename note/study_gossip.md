The key requirement is that the aggregate must be computable by fixed-size pairwise information exchanges; these typically terminate after a number of rounds of information exchange logarithmic in the system size, by which time an all-to-all information flow pattern will have been established.[1ï¼½

Typically gossip protocols are those that specifically run in a regular, periodic, relatively lazy, symmetric and decentralized manner; [1]

In general, it takes O(logN) rounds to reach all nodes, where N is the number of nodes. A round completes when every peer has initiated a gossip
exactly once. [3]
