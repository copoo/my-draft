The key requirement is that the aggregate must be computable by fixed-size pairwise information exchanges; these typically terminate after a number of rounds of information exchange logarithmic in the system size, by which time an all-to-all information flow pattern will have been established. ［1］

Typically gossip protocols are those that specifically run in a regular, periodic, relatively lazy, symmetric and decentralized manner; [1]
